# UI Assessment

## Get Started:

- To start, you should run `npm install` to ensure all dependancies are installed.

- Once that's done you can run the project by using `npm run dev`.

## General Notes:

- For this assignment I wanted to focus on the table first. I felt that given the time limit this would be the most productive and would showcase the majority of the content and functionality. I tried to approach this from the perspective of an internal stakeholder and as a stakeholder I would expect the information to be displayed in an easily digestable format first before worrying about additional functionality (select all, download, etc.).

- I decided to use TypeScript as a means to validate props and ensure that any bugs are handled before runtime. We could do without TypeScript but I feel it provides a better developer experience.

- Each component was broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces to reduce complexity and improve reusability, all of which make for happier and more productive developers. üòÅ

- In order to ensure accessibility best practices, the table is fully keyboard navigable and passess Lighthouse accessibility checks.
