# UI Test

## Get Started:

- To start you should run `npm install` to ensure all dependancies are installed.
- Once that's done you can run the project by using `npm run dev`.

## Running Tests:

- For this assignment, I wanted to show that I am able to follow best practices so I wrote some simple unit tests as a means to ensure code quality. I chose to use Vitest along with React Testing Library due the easy integration in a Vite project.
- To run unit tests you will need to use the `npm test` command.

## General Notes:

- For this assignment I decided to use TypeScript as a means to validate props and ensure that any bugs are caught ahead of time. We could do without TypeScript but I feel it provides a better developer experience.
